<h1>Welcome to My Mini-Site</h1>
<p>Welcome to my mini-site! I really appreciate you stopping by and checking it out. In case you're wondering, this site is a demo for the Web Design 101 course currently available for free at <a href="http://www.howtomakemywebsite.com">HowToMakeMyWebsite.com</a>.</p>
<p>Inside that course, you'll learn how to create this exact site from scratch, without using FrontPage, Dreamweaver, or any other website builder... you'll build this site from scratch using only a text editor.</p>
<p>So, if that sounds cool and you'd like to learn how to create your very own website from scratch, then head on over to <a href="http://www.howtomakemywebsite.com">HowToMakeMyWebsite.com</a> now to get all the details.</p>
